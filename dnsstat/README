Wireshark LUA Script for simple DNS response times measurement.
Invocation:
$ tshark -q -X lua_script:dnsstat.lua -r dns.pcap

It doesn't work at the moment, and yes, I do know that this does the same:

tshark -Tfields -e dns.time -r dns.pcap -Y 'dns.flags.response == 1'
0.159062000
0.000612000
0.000505000
0.085828000
0.000589000
0.000486000
...

However, I want to make up a full DNS statistics tool in Lua. I know how to
do it with other tools, but Lua, man. Lua.

Intersting as well:
tshark -Tfields -e dns.time -e dns.flags.rcode -e dns.count.answers -r
dns.pcap -Y 'dns.flags.response == 1'
